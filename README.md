## 🕯 About

I am a systems-oriented software engineer  
drawn to structure, rigor, and intellectual depth.

My work lives at the intersection of:

- Software Architecture  
- Financial Systems Engineering  
- Mathematical Foundations  
- ERP Systems  
- Clean Code Philosophy  

I design systems the way old scholars built libraries:  
carefully, deliberately, and with permanence in mind.
